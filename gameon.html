                    <p>During the Fall of 2017, a team of students and I worked with GameOn to develop a user interface for a chatbot dashboard for prospective users. As a team, we went through the steps learned in user experience design to analyze user needs and existing interfaces for creating chatbots. We found that non-technical users wanted a dashboard that provided quickness, ease of use, and an intuitive way to represent multi-step dialogues. We discussed the most important factors, including templated intents and a streamlined drag-n-drop dialogue page, and iterated through numerous design ideas to sharpen our vision. Ultimately, our decision tree took shape as a high level representation of dialogues that could easily be edited. We found that target users valued a place to add collaborators, channels, and additional dialogues. The dashboard addressed the current breakdowns and missed opportunities from the spreadsheets of the existing design. Moreover, we tested our screen designs with our target users to understand any difficulties they may have faced. Our ultimate goal was to provide an intuitive process for non-technical users to make chatbots for GameOn.
