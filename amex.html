                    <p>During my most recent work experience, I worked as a software engineering intern within the International Digital Aquisitions team at American Express in New York, NY. Specifically, I worked on technology solutions to help replace existing overnight batch processes used to communicate between their card application form and other verification systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We tackled these issues first in design and scoping sessions to understand how the current process worked and its shortcomings. As a result of those sessions, we decided to use the Kafka platform and focus on the India market to begin development. We continued to work throughout the internship with team members with domain-specific knowledge on the market and existing process to best scope the new design.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This led to the product we ultimately produced, a Java application that receives application forms in JSON format, processes it, and sends it to the appropriate verification systems in realtime. I worked heavily on the core backend functionality as well as business rules and unit testing for the application.</p>
