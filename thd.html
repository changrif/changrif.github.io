            <p>Those problem statements served as a basis for accomplishing our goals whilst balancing both user and business needs. What the associates in break pack really needed was a way to see their performance and the impact it made on goal. How important following the proper operating practices are and how they stand as a group.
                
            We tackled these issues first in a design studio, laying out the user interface in a way that wasn't over cluttered with data they did not need and brought emphasis on the most important of that data. We started with statistics like the team's individual and overall performance, cartons per hour, a graphical visualization of their progress to plan, and the most aged freight. Over the course of the summer, we went back and forth to Mccalla with both prototypes and live data to get their reactions and the reactions of leaders to the dashboard to validate parts that worked and continue iterating things that didn't work or needed refining.
                
            This led to our current product, a dynamically updating non-interactive dashboard application that’s intended to be displayed on television screens in the BP area. We found that overly technical statistics were more confusing and caused them to take more time looking at the screen.
                
            More than anything, we realize the goal of the RDC is to move cartons through the building and out as quickly as possible, so our application should aid that process without causing any disruption. It’s now been deployed for a little over two weeks now and we’re currently in the process of doing metrics testing to see how it affects their numbers and how impactful it is in their day to day job.</p>
