                    <p>From January until the end of May of 2019, I worked as a software engineering intern within Design & Engineering at Walt Disney World  Parks and Resorts. Specifically, I worked within the Software Tools & Logistics team to continue building on their internal release management software, Software Release System (SRS). Whenever a new version or launch occurs within any of the parks nationwide, it is the job of SRS to track and store the release information for record-keeping to ensure no information is lost.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I worked on developing new functionality for the SRS system throughout my internship - from migrating backups to the cloud to increasing usability to promote better record keeping amongst cast members. For example, I worked on a set of features to increase file size uploads for software releases. By modifying the upload process from a server-based to browser-based upload to the cloud, we could allow larger files to be uploaded. In addition, I learned a lot about user experience and probing for feedback to improve how users interacted with SRS. For example, I added a number of features to make the application more useful for quickly accessing and downloading media for engineers in the parks. I also built the foundation for unit and acceptance tests for the system.

                    <br>
                    I also worked extensively on infrastructure automation for the SRS system as well as other internal tools. For SRS, I wrote Chef scripts to quickly spin up a production-like development environment for local development and testing. I also helped out with other miscallaneous taks and maintance for attractions throughout the duration of my internship.</p>
